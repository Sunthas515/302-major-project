- Collections are contained in the java.util package
	- Created using syntax
        - Collection<E> c = new Collection<E>()
		- import java.util.ArrayList;
			var c = new ArrayList<String>();
			c.add("a");
			c.add("b");
			var ar = c.toArray(new String[0]);
			for (String str : ar) {
				System.out.println(str);
			}
			
- Collections and Arrays
	- Collections support iterators, arrays do not
	- Collections can grow in size at runtime; arrays cannot 
		- ArrayList can be used exactly the same as an array, although it uses more processing power (Personal Thought: so depending on implementation may want to use ArrayLists)
		- ArrayLists may use up to 4x as much cpu and memory
	- Collections only store objects 

- Vectors are not recommended moving forward (depreciated syntax) -> Better to use ArrayLists (have same functionality)

- Dictionaries are referred to as Maps
